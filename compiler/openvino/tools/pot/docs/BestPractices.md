   Saturation Issue <pot_saturation_issue>


The :doc:`Default Quantization <pot_default_quantization_usage>` of the Post-training Optimization Tool (POT) is
the fastest and easiest way to get a quantized model. It requires only some unannotated representative dataset to be provided in most cases. Therefore, it is recommended to use it as a starting point when it comes to model optimization. However, it can lead to significant accuracy deviation in some cases. The purpose of this article is to provide tips to address this issue.

.. note::

   POT uses inference on the CPU during model optimization. It means that ability to infer the original floating-point model is essential for model optimization. In case of the 8-bit quantization, it is recommended to run POT on the same CPU architecture when optimizing for CPU or VNNI-based CPU when quantizing for a non-CPU device, such as GPU, VPU, or GNA. It should help to avoid the impact of the :doc:`saturation issue <pot_saturation_issue>` that occurs on AVX and SSE-based CPU devices.


Improving accuracy after the Default Quantization
#################################################

Parameters of the Default Quantization algorithm with basic settings are presented below:

.. code-block:: py
   :force:

   {
       "name": "DefaultQuantization", # Optimization algorithm name
       "params": {
           "preset": "performance", # Preset [performance, mixed] which controls
                                    # the quantization scheme. For the CPU:
                                    # performance - symmetric quantization of weights and activations.
                                    # mixed - symmetric weights and asymmetric activations.
                                    # accuracy - the same as "mixed" for CPU, GPU, and GNA devices; asymmetric weights and activations for VPU device.
           "stat_subset_size": 300  # Size of the subset to calculate activations statistics that can be used
                                    # for quantization parameters calculation.
       }
   }


There are two alternatives in case of substantial accuracy degradation after applying this method:

1. Hyperparameters tuning.
2. AccuracyAwareQuantization algorithm.

Tuning Hyperparameters of the Default Quantization
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Default Quantization algorithm provides multiple hyperparameters which can be used to improve accuracy results for the fully-quantized model.
Below is a list of best practices that can be applied to improve accuracy without a substantial performance reduction with respect to default settings:

1. The first recommended option is to change the ``preset`` from ``performance`` to ``mixed``. This enables asymmetric quantization of activations and can be helpful for models with non-ReLU activation functions, for example, YOLO, EfficientNet, etc.
2. The next option is ``use_fast_bias``. Setting this option to ``false`` enables a different bias correction method which is more accurate, in general, and applied after model quantization as a part of the Default Quantization algorithm.

   .. note:: Changing this option can substantially increase quantization time in the POT tool.

3. Some model architectures require a special approach when being quantized. For example, Transformer-based models need to keep some operations in the original precision to preserve accuracy. That is why POT provides a ``model_type`` option to specify the model architecture. Now, only ``"transformer"`` type is available. Use it to quantize Transformer-based models, e.g. BERT.
4. Another important option is a `range_estimator`. It defines how to calculate the minimum and maximum of quantization range for weights and activations. For example, the following ``range_estimator`` for activations can improve the accuracy for Faster R-CNN-based networks:

   .. code-block:: py
      :force:

      {
          "name": "DefaultQuantization",
          "params": {
              "preset": "performance",
              "stat_subset_size": 300
              "activations": {                 # defines activation
                  "range_estimator": {         # defines how to estimate statistics
                      "max": {                 # right border of the quantizing floating-point range
                          "aggregator": "max", # use max(x) to aggregate statistics over calibration dataset
                          "type": "abs_max"    # use abs(max(x)) to get per-sample statistics
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
      }


5. The next option is ``stat_subset_size``. It controls the size of the calibration dataset used by POT to collect statistics for quantization parameters initialization. It is assumed that this dataset should contain a sufficient number of representative samples. Thus, varying this parameter may affect accuracy (higher is better). However, we empirically found that 300 samples are sufficient to get representative statistics in most cases.
6. The last option is ``ignored_scope``. It allows excluding some layers from the quantization process, i.e. their inputs will not be quantized. It may be helpful for some patterns for which it is known in advance that they drop accuracy when executing in low precision. For example, the ``DetectionOutput`` layer of the SSD model expressed as a subgraph should not be quantized to preserve the accuracy of Object Detection models. One of the sources for the ignored scope can be the Accuracy-aware algorithm which can revert layers to the original precision (see details below).

Find all the possible options and their description in the configuration `specification file <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/tools/pot/configs/default_quantization_spec.json>`__ in the POT directory.

Accuracy-aware Quantization
###########################

When the steps above do not lead to the accurate quantized model, you may use the :doc:`Accuracy-aware Quantization <pot_accuracyaware_usage>` algorithm which leads to mixed-precision models. A fragment of Accuracy-aware Quantization configuration with default settings is shown below:

.. code-block:: py
   :force:

   {
       "name": "AccuracyAwareQuantization",
       "params": {
           "preset": "performance",
           "stat_subset_size": 300,
           "maximal_drop": 0.01 # Maximum accuracy drop which has to be achieved after the quantization
       }
   }


Since the Accuracy-aware Quantization calls the Default Quantization at the first step it means that all the parameters of the latter one are also valid and can be applied to the accuracy-aware scenario.

.. note::

   In general, the potential increase in speed with the Accuracy-aware Quantization algorithm is not as high as with the Default Quantization, when the model gets fully quantized.


Reducing the performance gap of Accuracy-aware Quantization
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To improve model performance after Accuracy-aware Quantization, try the ``"tune_hyperparams"`` setting and set it to ``True``. It will enable searching for optimal quantization parameters before reverting layers to the "backup" precision. Note that this may impact the overall quantization time, though.

If you do not achieve the desired accuracy and performance after applying the Accuracy-aware Quantization algorithm or you need an accurate fully-quantized model, we recommend either using Quantization-Aware Training from :doc:`NNCF <tmo_introduction>`.
