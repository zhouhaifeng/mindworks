   :description: Learn how to install OpenVINO™ Runtime on Windows, Linux, and 
                 macOS operating systems, using a PyPi package.


Using the PyPI repository, you can install either OpenVINO™ Runtime or OpenVINO Development Tools on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems.
This article focuses on OpenVINO™ Runtime.

.. note

   If you install OpenVINO Development Tools, OpenVINO Runtime will also be installed as a dependency, so you don't need to install it separately.


Installing OpenVINO Runtime
###########################

For system requirements and troubleshooting, see https://pypi.org/project/openvino/

Step 1. Set Up Python Virtual Environment
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

To create a virtual environment, use the following command:


.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Windows
       :sync: windows

       .. code-block:: sh

          python -m venv openvino_env

    .. tab-item:: Linux and macOS
       :sync: linux-and-macos

       .. code-block:: sh

          python3 -m venv openvino_env


Step 2. Activate Virtual Environment
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Windows
       :sync: windows

       .. code-block:: sh

          openvino_env\Scripts\activate

    .. tab-item:: Linux and macOS
       :sync: linux-and-macos

       .. code-block:: sh

          source openvino_env/bin/activate


.. important::

   The above command must be re-run every time a new command terminal window is opened.


Step 3. Set Up and Update PIP to the Highest Version
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Use the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   python -m pip install --upgrade pip


Step 4. Install the Package
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Use the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   python -m pip install openvino


Step 5. Verify that the Package Is Installed
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Run the command below:

.. code-block:: sh

   python -c "from openvino.runtime import Core; print(Core().available_devices)"

If installation was successful, you will see the list of available devices. Congratulations! You have finished installing OpenVINO Runtime.
