   :description: Learn how to install OpenVINO™ Runtime on Windows operating 
                 system, using an archive file, which is a recommended 
                 installation method for C++ developers.


With the OpenVINO™ 2023.0 release, you can download and use archive files to install OpenVINO Runtime. The archive files contain pre-built binaries and library files needed for OpenVINO Runtime, as well as code samples.

Installing OpenVINO Runtime from archive files is recommended for C++ developers. If you are working with Python, the PyPI package has everything needed for Python development and deployment on CPU and GPUs. See the :doc:`Install OpenVINO from PyPI <openvino_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_pip>` page for instructions on how to install OpenVINO Runtime for Python using PyPI.

.. note::

   Since the OpenVINO™ 2022.1 release, the following development tools: Model Optimizer, Post-Training Optimization Tool, Model Downloader and other Open Model Zoo tools, Accuracy Checker, and Annotation Converter can be installed via `pypi.org <https://pypi.org/project/openvino-dev/>`__ only.


See the `Release Notes <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/release-notes/openvino/2023-0.html>`__ for more information on updates in the latest release.

Installing OpenVINO Runtime
###########################

.. _install-openvino-archive-windows:

Step 1: Download and Install OpenVINO Core Components
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Create an ``Intel`` folder in the ``C:\Program Files (x86)\`` directory. Skip this step if the folder already exists.

   You can also do this via command-lines. Open a new command prompt window as administrator by right-clicking **Command Prompt** from the Start menu and select **Run as administrator**, and then run the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mkdir "C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel"


   .. note::

      ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel`` is the recommended folder. You may also use a different path if desired or if you don't have administrator privileges on your computer.


2. Download the `OpenVINO Runtime archive file for Windows <https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/repositories/openvino/packages/2023.0.1/windows/>`__ to your local ``Downloads`` folder.

   If you prefer using command-lines, run the following commands in the command prompt window you opened:

   .. code-block:: sh

      cd <user_home>/Downloads
      curl -L https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/repositories/openvino/packages/2023.0.1/windows/w_openvino_toolkit_windows_2023.0.1.11005.fa1c41994f3_x86_64.zip --output openvino_2023.0.1.zip


   .. note::

      A ``.sha256`` file is provided together with the archive file to validate your download process. To do that, download the ``.sha256`` file from the same repository and run ``CertUtil -hashfile openvino_2023.0.1.zip SHA256``. Compare the returned value in the output with what's in the ``.sha256`` file: if the values are the same, you have downloaded the correct file successfully; if not, create a Support ticket `here <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/contact-intel.html>`__.


3. Use your favorite tool to extract the archive file, rename the extracted folder, and move it to the ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel`` directory.

   To do this step using command-line, run the following commands in the command prompt window you opened:

   .. code-block:: sh

      tar -xf openvino_2023.0.1.zip
      ren w_openvino_toolkit_windows_2023.0.0.10926.b4452d56304_x86_64 openvino_2023.0.1
      move openvino_2023.0.1 "C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel"


4. For simplicity, it is useful to create a symbolic link. Open a command prompt window as administrator (see Step 1 for how to do this) and run the following commands:

   .. code-block:: sh

      cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel
      mklink /D openvino_2023 openvino_2023.0.1


   .. note::

      If you have already installed a previous release of OpenVINO 2022, a symbolic link to the ``openvino_2023`` folder may already exist. If you want to override it, navigate to the ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel`` folder and delete the existing linked folder before running the ``mklink`` command.


Congratulations, you finished the installation! The ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\openvino_2023`` folder now contains the core components for OpenVINO. If you used a different path in Step 1, you will find the ``openvino_2023`` folder there. The path to the ``openvino_2023`` directory is also referred as ``<INSTALL_DIR>`` throughout the OpenVINO documentation.

.. _set-the-environment-variables-windows:

Step 2: Configure the Environment
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You must update several environment variables before you can compile and run OpenVINO™ applications. Open the Command Prompt, and run the ``setupvars.bat`` batch file to temporarily set your environment variables. If your ``<INSTALL_DIR>`` is not ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\openvino_2023``, use the correct directory instead.

.. code-block:: sh

   "C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\openvino_2023\setupvars.bat"


.. important::

   The above command must be re-run every time a new Command Prompt window is opened.


.. note::

   If you see an error indicating Python is not installed, Python may not be added to the PATH environment variable (as described `here <https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#finding-the-python-executable>`__). Check your system environment variables, and add Python if necessary.


The environment variables are set. Continue to the next section if you want to download any additional components.

.. _model-optimizer-windows:

Step 3 (Optional): Install Additional Components
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

OpenVINO Development Tools is a set of utilities for working with OpenVINO and OpenVINO models. It provides tools like Model Optimizer, Benchmark Tool, Post-Training Optimization Tool, and Open Model Zoo Downloader. If you install OpenVINO Runtime using archive files, OpenVINO Development Tools must be installed separately.

See the :doc:`Install OpenVINO Development Tools <openvino_docs_install_guides_install_dev_tools>` page for step-by-step installation instructions.

OpenCV is necessary to run demos from Open Model Zoo (OMZ). Some OpenVINO samples can also extend their capabilities when compiled with OpenCV as a dependency. To install OpenCV for OpenVINO, see the `instructions on GitHub <https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/BuildOpenCV4OpenVINO>`.

.. _optional-steps-windows:

Step 4 (Optional): Configure Inference on non-CPU Devices
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

OpenVINO Runtime has a plugin architecture that enables you to run inference on multiple devices without rewriting your code. Supported devices include integrated GPUs, discrete GPUs and GNAs. See the instructions below to set up OpenVINO on these devices.
