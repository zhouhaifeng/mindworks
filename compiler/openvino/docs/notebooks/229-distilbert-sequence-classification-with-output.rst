Sentiment Analysis with OpenVINO™
=================================

**Sentiment analysis** is the use of natural language processing, text
analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically
identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective
information. This notebook demonstrates how to convert and run a
sequence classification model using OpenVINO.

Imports
-------

.. code:: ipython3

    import warnings
    from pathlib import Path
    import time
    from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer
    import numpy as np
    from openvino.tools import mo
    from openvino.runtime import PartialShape, Type, serialize, Core

Initializing the Model
----------------------

We will use the transformer-based
`distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english <https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english>`__
model from Hugging Face.

.. code:: ipython3

    checkpoint = "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
    model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
        pretrained_model_name_or_path=checkpoint
    )

Initializing the Tokenizer
--------------------------

Text Preprocessing cleans the text-based input data so it can be fed
into the model.
`Tokenization <https://towardsdatascience.com/tokenization-for-natural-language-processing-a179a891bad4>`__
splits paragraphs and sentences into smaller units that can be more
easily assigned meaning. It involves cleaning the data and assigning
tokens or IDs to the words, so they are represented in a vector space
where similar words have similar vectors. This helps the model
understand the context of a sentence. Here, we will use
`AutoTokenizer <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/tokenizer>`__
- a pre-trained tokenizer from Hugging Face: .

.. code:: ipython3

    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
        pretrained_model_name_or_path=checkpoint
    )

Convert Model to OpenVINO Intermediate Representation format
------------------------------------------------------------

`Model
Optimizer <https://docs.openvino.ai/2023.0/openvino_docs_MO_DG_Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.html>`__
is a cross-platform command-line tool that facilitates the transition
between training and deployment environments, performs static model
analysis, and adjusts deep learning models for optimal execution on
end-point target devices.

.. code:: ipython3

    ir_xml_name = checkpoint + ".xml"
    MODEL_DIR = "model/"
    ir_xml_path = Path(MODEL_DIR) / ir_xml_name
    ov_model = mo.convert_model(model, input=[mo.InputCutInfo(shape=PartialShape([1, -1]), type=Type.i64), mo.InputCutInfo(shape=PartialShape([1, -1]), type=Type.i64)])
    serialize(ov_model, ir_xml_path)

You can safely ignore this warning if you use this function to create tensors out of constant variables that would be the same every time you call this function. In any other case, this might cause the trace to be incorrect.

OpenVINO™ Runtime uses the `Infer
Request <https://docs.openvino.ai/2023.0/openvino_docs_OV_UG_Infer_request.html>`__
mechanism which enables running models on different devices in
asynchronous or synchronous manners. The model graph is sent as an
argument to the OpenVINO API and an inference request is created. The
default inference mode is AUTO but it can be changed according to
requirements and hardware available. You can explore the different
inference modes and their usage `in
documentation. <https://docs.openvino.ai/2023.0/openvino_docs_Runtime_Inference_Modes_Overview.html>`__

.. code:: ipython3

    warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
    core = Core()
    compiled_model = core.compile_model(ov_model)
    infer_request = compiled_model.create_infer_request()

.. code:: ipython3

    def softmax(x):
        """
        Defining a softmax function to extract
        the prediction from the output of the IR format
        Parameters: Logits array

        """
    
        e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))
        return e_x / e_x.sum()

Inference
---------

.. code:: ipython3

    def infer(input_text):
        """

        to read the input and infer the result
        into 2 classes: Positive or Negative.

        Returns: Label: Positive or Negative.
        """
    
        input_text = tokenizer(
            input_text,
            truncation=True,
            return_tensors="np",
        )
        inputs = dict(input_text)
        label = {0: "NEGATIVE", 1: "POSITIVE"}
        result = infer_request.infer(inputs=inputs)
        for i in result.values():
            probability = np.argmax(softmax(i))
