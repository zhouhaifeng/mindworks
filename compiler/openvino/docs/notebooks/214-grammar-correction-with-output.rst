Grammatical Error Correction with OpenVINO
==========================================

AI-based auto-correction products are becoming increasingly popular due
to their ease of use, editing speed, and affordability. These products
improve the quality of written text in emails, blogs, and chats.

Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) is the task of correcting different
types of errors in text such as spelling, punctuation, grammatical and
word choice errors. GEC is typically formulated as a sentence correction
task. A GEC system takes a potentially erroneous sentence as input and
is expected to transform it into a more correct version. See the example
given below:

=========================== ==========================
Input (Erroneous)           Output (Corrected)
=========================== ==========================
I like to rides my bicycle. I like to ride my bicycle.
=========================== ==========================

As shown in the image below, different types of errors in written
language can be corrected.

This tutorial shows how to perform grammatical error correction using
OpenVINO. We will use pre-trained models from the `Hugging Face
Transformers <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index>`__
library. To simplify the user experience, the `Hugging Face
Optimum <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum>`__ library is used to
convert the models to OpenVINOâ„¢ IR format.

It consists of the following steps:

-  Install prerequisites
-  Download and convert models from a public source using the `OpenVINO
   integration with Hugging Face
   Optimum <https://huggingface.co/blog/openvino>`__.
-  Create an inference pipeline for grammatical error checking

How does it work?
-----------------

A Grammatical Error Correction task can be thought of as a
sequence-to-sequence task where a model is trained to take a
grammatically incorrect sentence as input and return a grammatically
correct sentence as output. We will use the
`FLAN-T5 <https://huggingface.co/pszemraj/flan-t5-large-grammar-synthesis>`__
model finetuned on an expanded version of the
`JFLEG <https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/jfleg>`__ dataset.

The version of FLAN-T5 released with the `Scaling Instruction-Finetuned
Language Models <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf>`__ paper is an
enhanced version of `T5 <https://huggingface.co/t5-large>`__ that has
been finetuned on a combination of tasks. The paper explores instruction
finetuning with a particular focus on scaling the number of tasks,
scaling the model size, and finetuning on chain-of-thought data. The
paper discovers that overall instruction finetuning is a general method
that improves the performance and usability of pre-trained language
models.

For more details about the model, please check out
`paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416>`__, original
`repository <https://github.com/google-research/t5x>`__, and Hugging
Face `model card <https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-large>`__

Additionally, to reduce the number of sentences required to be
processed, you can perform grammatical correctness checking. This task
should be considered as a simple binary text classification, where the
model gets input text and predicts label 1 if a text contains any
grammatical errors and 0 if it does not. You will use the
`roberta-base-CoLA <https://huggingface.co/textattack/roberta-base-CoLA>`__
model, the RoBERTa Base model finetuned on the CoLA dataset. The RoBERTa
model was proposed in `RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining
Approach paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692>`__. It builds on BERT
and modifies key hyperparameters, removing the next-sentence
pre-training objective and training with much larger mini-batches and
learning rates. Additional details about the model can be found in a
`blog
post <https://ai.facebook.com/blog/roberta-an-optimized-method-for-pretraining-self-supervised-nlp-systems/>`__
by Meta AI and in the `Hugging Face
documentation <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/roberta>`__

Now that we know more about FLAN-T5 and RoBERTa, let us get started. ðŸš€

Prerequisites
-------------

First, we need to install the `Hugging Face
Optimum <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index>`__ library
accelerated by OpenVINO integration. The Hugging Face Optimum API is a
high-level API that enables us to convert and quantize models from the
Hugging Face Transformers library to the OpenVINOâ„¢ IR format. For more
details, refer to the `Hugging Face Optimum
documentation <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/inference>`__.

.. code:: ipython3

    !pip install -q "git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel.git" onnx onnxruntime

Download and Convert Models
---------------------------

Optimum Intel can be used to load optimized models from the `Hugging
Face Hub <https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/hf.co/models>`__ and
create pipelines to run an inference with OpenVINO Runtime using Hugging
Face APIs. The Optimum Inference models are API compatible with Hugging
Face Transformers models. This means we just need to replace
AutoModelForXxx class with the corresponding OVModelForXxx class.

Below is an example of the RoBERTa text classification model

.. code:: diff

   -from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification
   +from optimum.intel.openvino import OVModelForSequenceClassification
   from transformers import AutoTokenizer, pipeline

   model_id = "textattack/roberta-base-CoLA"
   -model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_id)
   +model = OVModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_id, from_transformers=True)

Model class initialization starts with calling ``from_pretrained``
method. When downloading and converting Transformers model, the
parameter ``from_transformers=True`` should be added. We can save the
converted model for the next usage with the ``save_pretrained`` method.
Tokenizer class and pipelines API are compatible with Optimum models.

.. code:: ipython3

    from pathlib import Path
    from transformers import pipeline, AutoTokenizer
    from optimum.intel.openvino import OVModelForSeq2SeqLM, OVModelForSequenceClassification

Grammar Checker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: ipython3

    grammar_checker_model_id = "textattack/roberta-base-CoLA"
    grammar_checker_dir = Path("roberta-base-cola")
    grammar_checker_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(grammar_checker_model_id)
    
    if grammar_checker_dir.exists():
        grammar_checker_model = OVModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(grammar_checker_dir)
    else:
        grammar_checker_model = OVModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(grammar_checker_model_id, from_transformers=True)
        grammar_checker_model.save_pretrained(grammar_checker_dir)

Let us check model work, using inference pipeline for
``text-classification`` task. You can find more information about usage
Hugging Face inference pipelines in this
`tutorial <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/pipeline_tutorial>`__

.. code:: ipython3

    input_text = "They are moved by salar energy"
    grammar_checker_pipe = pipeline("text-classification", model=grammar_checker_model, tokenizer=grammar_checker_tokenizer)
    result = grammar_checker_pipe(input_text)[0]
    print(f"input text: {input_text}")
    print(f'predicted label: {"contains_errors" if result["label"] == "LABEL_1" else "no errors"}')
    print(f'predicted score: {result["score"] :.2}')


.. parsed-literal::

    input text: They are moved by salar energy
    predicted label: contains_errors
    predicted score: 0.88


Great! Looks like the model can detect errors in the sample.

Grammar Corrector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The steps for loading the Grammar Corrector model are very similar,
except for the model class that is used. Because FLAN-T5 is a
sequence-to-sequence text generation model, we should use the
``OVModelForSeq2SeqLM`` class and the ``text2text-generation`` pipeline
to run it.

.. code:: ipython3

    grammar_corrector_model_id = "pszemraj/flan-t5-large-grammar-synthesis"
    grammar_corrector_dir = Path("flan-t5-large-grammar-synthesis")
    grammar_corrector_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(grammar_corrector_model_id)
    
    if grammar_corrector_dir.exists():
        grammar_corrector_model = OVModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(grammar_corrector_dir)
    else:
        grammar_corrector_model = OVModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(grammar_corrector_model_id, from_transformers=True)
        grammar_corrector_model.save_pretrained(grammar_corrector_dir)

    In-place op on output of tensor.shape. See https://pytorch.org/docs/master/onnx.html#avoid-inplace-operations-when-using-tensor-shape-in-tracing-mode


.. code:: ipython3

    grammar_corrector_pipe = pipeline("text2text-generation", model=grammar_corrector_model, tokenizer=grammar_corrector_tokenizer)

.. code:: ipython3

    result = grammar_corrector_pipe(input_text)[0]
    print(f"input text:     {input_text}") 
    print(f'generated text: {result["generated_text"]}') 


.. parsed-literal::

    input text:     They are moved by salar energy
    generated text: They are powered by solar energy.


Nice! The result looks pretty good!

Prepare Demo Pipeline
---------------------

Now let us put everything together and create the pipeline for grammar
correction. The pipeline accepts input text, verifies its correctness,
and generates the correct version if required. It will consist of
several steps:

1. Split text on sentences.
2. Check grammatical correctness for each sentence using Grammar
   Checker.
3. Generate an improved version of the sentence if required.

.. code:: ipython3

        Returns:
        list: A list of sentence batches. Each sentence batch is a list of sentences.
        """
        # Split the text into sentences using regex
        sentences = re.split(r"(?<=[^A-Z].[.?]) +(?=[A-Z])", text)
    
        # Initialize a list to store the sentence batches
        sentence_batches = []
    
        # Initialize a temporary list to store the current batch of sentences
        temp_batch = []
    
        # Iterate through the sentences
        for sentence in sentences:
            # Add the sentence to the temporary batch
            temp_batch.append(sentence)
    
            # If the length of the temporary batch is between 2 and 3 sentences, or if it is the last batch, add it to the list of sentence batches
            if len(temp_batch) >= 2 and len(temp_batch) <= 3 or sentence == sentences[-1]:
                sentence_batches.append(temp_batch)
                temp_batch = []
    
        return sentence_batches
    
    
    def correct_text(text: str, checker: transformers.pipelines.Pipeline, corrector: transformers.pipelines.Pipeline, separator: str = " ") -> str:
        """

            if results[0]["label"] != "LABEL_1" or (

        # Join the corrected text into a single string
        corrected_text = separator.join(corrected_text)
    
        return corrected_text

Let us see it in action. Enter text to be corrected in the text box and
execute the following cells.
